# Neueda Hackathon: Group-2

# Project Brief
As part of our internship program at Citi, we are participating in an associated hackathon organised by Neueda (https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/neueda.conygre.com/Sites/Tech_Intern_TI_EMEA_APP/site/index.html). <br>
The open-ended goal is to create an interesting proof-of-concept web app in one of Citi's business domains (stocks, personal banking, etc.) <br>
Technologies used must include Java, Springboot, Maven, SwaggerUI, and a web-development framework of our choosing.

# Our Team, and Our Project
We are Group-2, consisting of Kayee Liu, Colm Livingstone and Declan McCabe. <br>
Our project is a personal banking app, that facilitates the management of funds in an account, and the sending of money between accounts. <br>

# Installation Instructions
The backend requires Springboot, a valid JRE, and Maven to be installed.  Maven handles any other necessarcy dependencies. <br>
Once the Springboot project is running, the api documentation can be found at: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html. <br>
The frontend can be ran by opening the `index.html` file at the root of the project. <br>
Some read-to-go accounts and login details can be found in the DemoApplication.java file in `Backend/demo/src/main/java/com/example/demo/` directory.
